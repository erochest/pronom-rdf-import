This imports some specific data from a dump of Pronom's linked data and outputs
it as JSON.

Currently, we're getting the Pronom dump from
[mpollice/LinkedOpenData](https://github.com/mpollice/LinkedOpenData).

This outputs a JSON object with extensions as properties and arrays of some
basic information about those extensions as output.
